Hello
Ashkan Hafezi and Alireza Peymani Rad will talk to you.
In this project, we tried to design an online store application under Windows, like the Amazon store, to save people from overwhelming traffic.
For this purpose, we have used the C++ programming language, object-oriented thinking, and the QT framework.
Our program consists of 6 main sections which are introduced below:
1- Login page

2- Management page
3- Customer page
4- Seller page
5-Transactions
6- Game for the buyer
To run our program, you must first install it using the installer and then use it by creating a user account.
I hope you enjoy the environment of the program and find it useful
Goodbye ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€
